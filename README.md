# BBQ-Journal Backend Notes

Built on greenpioneer's wonderful [MEN Stack](https://github.com/greenpioneersolutions/menstackjs). Other technologies: 
<ul>
  <li>Multer for file upload
  <li>ShellJS trickery for filesystem access between the front and backend NodeJS directories
</ul>

This repo only contains backend files for BBQ-Journal.com. Here is the repo containing the (completely separate) [frontend](https://github.com/benskyio/bbqjournal).
